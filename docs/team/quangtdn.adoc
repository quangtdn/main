=== Enhancement Added: `phone`

==== External behavior
Locating persons by phone number.

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=phone]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Searching a contact by partial chain of number is a convenient and efficient feature especially when user has to deal with a large contact list. +
For example, a user Michael wants to search for his best friend John Cena in NeoXPro. Unfortunately there are 6 contacts with the same name John Cena stored in NeoXPro so using `find` command confuses Michael a lot with 6 output contacts. However, using `phone` command, Michael can directly search for his best friend immediately via his phone.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: Profile Page

Allow user to optionally store the profile page of each person in contact list.
The profile page for a person will appear in UI as long as it is stored.
When a person is selected, his/her profile page will be loaded in UI.

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

=== Enhancement Added: Improve `delete` command

==== External behavior
Using 'delete' command, user can now delete multiple persons from the contact list at a time.

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=delete]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users now don't have to manually delete each contact at a time.

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: `export`

==== External behavior
Export the contact list of NeoXPRO into a text file.

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

=== Enhancement Added: Improve `Select` command

==== External behavior
When a person is selected, his/her profile page is displayed (if it's stored)

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=select]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Let users easily access social media and improve experience. Employers can also make use of this feature to quickly access candidates' CVs or profile pages.

==== Implementation

---
In order to make `select` command load a person's `ProfilePage` object if it exists, we modify method `handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent()` in `BrowserPanel` that is in charge of updating a person panel: +
[source, java]
----
 private void handlePersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent(PersonPanelSelectionChangedEvent event) {
     //...load `person` from the `select` command...
     if (person.getProfilePage().hasProfilePage()) {
         loadProfilePage(person);
     } else {
         loadPersonPage(person);
     }
 }
 //...
 private void loadProfilePage(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
      //This method load the profile page of the in
      loadPage("https://" + person.getProfilePage().toString());
  }
----

The method `loadProfilePage(ReadOnlyPerson person)` is implemented to load the profile page of the input `person`.
